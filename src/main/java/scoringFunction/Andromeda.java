/**
 * This class calculates cumulative binominal probability based scores with
 * considering intensities from experimental spectra to
 * cumulativeBinomialProbability these.
 *
 * n: number of matched peaks
 *
 * N: number of theoretical peaks
 *
 * p: probability,topN/windowSize from a Filter object. Note that topN is [1-10]
 *
 * Note that cumulative binominal probability function calculates the score as
 * inclusive (not exclusive)
 *
 *
 * For each filtered peakList with a given topN parameter, p is calculated as
 * explained and cumulative binominal probability based scoring function part is
 * calculated as:
 *
 * Probability_Part (PP) = -10*[-log(P)]
