# Cross linked peptides

This program is consisted by 3 packages: Database construction, Theoretical spectra generation, Scoring

## STEP1: Database construction

A customized protein database is generated. 
Here there is no alpha-beta/beta-alpha order.
The entries are alpha-beta/alpha-Reversed(beta).

Note that the database must be GENERIC formatted! 
See the link above to format your protein database as generic

The crucial thing is to set miscleavaged number (Recommended:2, if this value get bigger, the search space will increase drastically).
